                    Sakhi is a romatic based movie in which, Kartik is an engineering college student in a city. Santi is a medical student living in the same place. 
                    Their love started by observing each other while traveling. As their love blossoms over a period of time, 
                    the couple informs their respective parents to talk with each other for the marriage proposal. 
                    Since Kartik belongs to rich family and Santi to a middle class family, there is some amount of friction in the talks which results in ego clash. 
                    Santi being a conservative girl decides to part with Kartik since the family ties are going to be strained. But the separated lovers could not
                     keep themselves away from seeing each other That resulted in Kartik and Santi getting married to each other at a registrar office and keeping their parents in dark.
